# **Basic Computer Vision Using Convolution Neural Network**

## **Description**
In this project I tried a Computer Vision program, with the 
hype over autonomous driving, I thought I should find out myself
how this technology works. In the interest of sharing a very simple
algorithm [or program], that anyone at a beginner level in AI can understand
and run on their desktop machines, because it takes much computing power
to create and run such a program. I even used the GPUs provided by Google Colab
to develop this piece of softare.

This program basically looks at hand written images of all base 10 numbering
system and determines which of the figures is in the image. Note that 
all these images are written in totally different hand-writings, and
hence comes the challenge for the computer. Some of these hand-writings
are unclear even to the human-eye. You might thing you see a 7 and the 
file label will tell you that the figure you're looking at it a 2.

## **Getting Started**

Simply clone the repository and run the .ipynb file in jupyter
notebook, Goodgle Colabotary, or any other text editor that 
supports the iPython Notebook. And Just click the 'Restart & Run All'
option and the file will run itself...

## **Results**

This model achieved pretty amazing results. The results are well 
documented in the iPython notebook.
